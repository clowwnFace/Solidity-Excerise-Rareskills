# Solidity RareSkills Bootcamp Completion

Hello there, ramenboy here.

Today marks the day I completed my Solidity RareSkills Bootcamp, a journey that spanned over 3 weeks. It was a period filled with lots of hard work, dedication, feelings of joy and frustration, and so much more. Despite my previous experiences in Solidity, I felt the need to learn and understand more.

In this 3-week intensive Solidity Bootcamp, I was able to learn lots of amazing new concepts and develop over 26 Solidity smart contracts. This achievement has significantly boosted my confidence as a Solidity engineer.

## What I Learned

During the bootcamp, I covered a wide range of topics, including:

- Development environments, specifically focused on Foundry
- Fixed data types in Solidity
- Arithmetic, if statements, for loops
- Introduction to arrays and strings, nested arrays
- Storage variables, arrays in storage
- Mappings, nested mappings, `msg.sender`, `address(this)`
- Constructor, `require`
- Building my own ERC20 token
- Tuples
- ABI and low-level EVM workings
- Building my own token swap and deploying it on the Sepolia Testnet
- Payable, `receive`, `block.timestamp`, `block.number`
- Events
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Modifiers, immutable variables
- Constants, strings
- Structs

## Mini Projects

I am honored to say that I developed a  project in each aspect of the bootcamp, going through each of the 30+ concepts in Solidity.
